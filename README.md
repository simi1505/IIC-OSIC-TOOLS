# IIC-OSIC-TOOLS

[![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/DOI/10.5281/zenodo.14387234.svg)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.14387234)

**IIC-OSIC-TOOLS** (Integrated Infrastructure for Collaborative Open Source IC Tools) is an all-in-one Docker/Podman container for open-source-based integrated circuit designs for analog and digital circuit flows. The CPU architectures `x86_64/amd64` and `aarch64/arm64` are natively supported based on Ubuntu 24.04 LTS (since release `2025.01`). This collection of tools is curated by the [**Department for Integrated Circuits (ICD), Johannes Kepler University (JKU)**](https://iic.jku.at).

## 1. How to Use These Open-Source (and Free) IC Design Tools

**For great step-to-step instructions of installation and operation of our tool collection, please check out Kwantae Kim's [Setting Up Open Source Tools with Docker](https://kwantaekim.github.io/2024/05/25/OSE-Docker/)!**

It supports multiple *modes of operation*:

1. Using a complete desktop environment (XFCE) in `Xvnc` (a VNC server), either directly accessing it with a VNC client of your choice or the integrated [noVNC](https://novnc.com) server that runs in your browser.
2. Using a local X11 server and directly showing the application windows on your desktop.
3. Using a Jupyter Notebook running inside the container, opened on the hosts browser.
4. Using it as a development container in Visual Studio Code (or other IDEs)

### 1.0 Quick install (one-liner)

If you just want to get going on a fresh machine, the repository ships with an
interactive installer that takes care of the prerequisites (Git, Docker /
Docker Desktop or Podman, WSL2 on Windows, XQuartz on macOS) and clones this
repository for you. Every action is gated behind a `[y/N]` confirmation prompt.

**Linux and macOS** (Bash, `curl` required):

```bash
curl -fsSL https://osic.tools/install.sh | bash
```

**Windows 10 / 11** (PowerShell, run as Administrator for WSL2):

```powershell
powershell -c "irm https://osic.tools/install.ps1 | iex"
```

If you would rather review the script first (recommended), download it and run
it locally:

```bash
curl -fsSLO https://osic.tools/install.sh && less install.sh && bash install.sh
```

or on Windows, after cloning the repository, simply double-click
[install.bat](install.bat) (a thin shim around [install.ps1](install.ps1)).

The installer is **idempotent** — re-running it will skip components that are
already installed. It refuses to run as `root` on Linux/macOS and refuses to
clone into system directories. If you prefer a manual installation, follow
the three steps below instead.

### 1.1 Step 1: Clone/download this GitHub repository onto your computer

Use the green **Code** button, and either download the zip file or do a

```bash
git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/iic-jku/iic-osic-tools.git
```

### 1.2 Step 2: Install Docker on your computer

See instructions on how to do this in the section [**Quick Launch for Designers**](#4-quick-launch-for-designers) further down in this `README`.

### 1.3 Step 3: Start and Use a Docker Container based on our IIC-OSIC-TOOLS Image

Enter the directory of this repository on your computer, and use one of the methods described in the section [**Quick Launch for Designers**](#4-quick-launch-for-designers) to start up and run a Docker container based on our image. The easiest way is probably to use the **VNC** mode.

If you do this the first time, or we have pushed an updated image to DockerHub, this can take a while since the image is pulled (loaded) automatically from DockerHub. Since this image is ca. 4 GB, this takes time, depending on your internet speed. Please note that this compressed image will be extracted on your drive, so please provide at least **20 GB of free drive space**. If, after a while, the consumed space gets larger, this may be due to unused images piling up. In this case, delete old ones; please consult the internet for instructions on operating Docker.

If you know what you are doing and want full root access without a graphical interface, please use

```bash
./start_shell.sh
```

This mode is deliberately shell-only: it forwards no X11/Wayland socket and no X authority cookie, so GUI tools started from that shell fall back to text mode. Use `./start_x.sh` or `./start_vnc.sh` for graphical work.

## 2. Installed PDKs

As of the `2022.12` tag, the following open-source process-development kits (PDKs) are pre-installed, and the table shows how to switch by setting environment variables (you can do this per project by putting this into `.designinit` as explained below):

| SkyWater Technologies `sky130A` |
|---|

```bash
export PDK=sky130A
export PDKPATH=$PDK_ROOT/$PDK
export STD_CELL_LIBRARY=sky130_fd_sc_hd
export SPICE_USERINIT_DIR=$PDKPATH/libs.tech/ngspice
export KLAYOUT_PATH=$PDKPATH/libs.tech/klayout
```

| Global Foundries `gf180mcuD` |
|---|

```bash
export PDK=gf180mcuD
export PDKPATH=$PDK_ROOT/$PDK
export STD_CELL_LIBRARY=gf180mcu_fd_sc_mcu7t5v0
export SPICE_USERINIT_DIR=$PDKPATH/libs.tech/ngspice
export KLAYOUT_PATH=$PDKPATH/libs.tech/klayout
```

| IHP Microelectronics `ihp-sg13g2` |
|---|

```bash
export PDK=ihp-sg13g2
export PDKPATH=$PDK_ROOT/$PDK
export STD_CELL_LIBRARY=sg13g2_stdcell
export SPICE_USERINIT_DIR=$PDKPATH/libs.tech/ngspice
export KLAYOUT_PATH=$PDKPATH/libs.tech/klayout
```

| IHP Microelectronics `ihp-sg13cmos5l` |
|---|

```bash
export PDK=ihp-sg13cmos5l
export PDKPATH=$PDK_ROOT/$PDK
export STD_CELL_LIBRARY=sg13cmos5l_stdcell
export SPICE_USERINIT_DIR=$PDKPATH/libs.tech/ngspice
export KLAYOUT_PATH=$PDKPATH/libs.tech/klayout
```

Probably the best way to switch between PDKs is to use the command `sak-pdk`. When called without arguments a list of installed PDKs is shown. To e.g. switch to IHP enter

```bash
sak-pdk ihp-sg13g2
```

or to switch to sky130A enter

```bash
sak-pdk sky130A
```

More options for selecting digital standard cell libraries are available; please check the PDK directories.

## 4. Quick Launch for Designers

Download and install **Docker** for your operating system:

- [All platforms (Linux)](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)
- [Windows](https://desktop.docker.com/win/main/amd64/Docker%20Desktop%20Installer.exe)
- [Mac with Intel Chip](https://desktop.docker.com/mac/main/amd64/Docker.dmg)
- [Mac with Apple Chip](https://desktop.docker.com/mac/main/arm64/Docker.dmg)

Note for Linux: Do not run docker commands or the start scripts as root (`sudo`)! Follow the instructions in [Post-installation steps for Linux](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/linux-postinstall/)

The following start scripts are intended as helper scripts for local or small-scale (single instance) deployment. Consider starting the containers with a custom start script if you need to run many instances.

### 4.1 Customizing Environment

All user data is persistently placed in the directory pointed to by the environment variable `DESIGNS` (the default is `$HOME/eda/designs` for Linux/macOS and `%USERPROFILE%\eda\designs` for Windows, respectively).

If a file `.designinit` is put in this directory, it is sourced last when starting the Docker environment. In this way, users can adapt settings to their needs.

### 4.2 Using VNC and noVNC

This mode is recommended for remote operation on a separate server or if you prefer the convenience of a full desktop environment. To start it up, you can use (in a Bash/Unix shell):

```bash
./start_vnc.sh
```

On Windows, you can use the equivalent batch script (if the defaults are acceptable, it can also be started by double-clicking in Explorer):

```terminal
.\start_vnc.bat
```

You can now access the Desktop Environment through your browser at `http://localhost:<WEBSERVER_PORT>/?password=abc123`, where `abc123` is the default password. `WEBSERVER_PORT` defaults to `80` (so plain [http://localhost](http://localhost) works), except with rootless Podman — including on macOS and Windows — where it defaults to `8080`; the start scripts print the exact URL. Omit the `?password=` part to be prompted for it instead.

The browser session uses the full noVNC client, whose control bar (the small tab on the left edge) provides clipboard transfer to and from the container, fullscreen, ctrl-alt-del, and connection settings. By default the container desktop resizes to match the browser window; change "Scaling Mode" in the settings panel if you prefer a fixed resolution, and your choice is remembered.

#### 4.2.1 Variables for VNC

Both scripts will use default settings, which you can tweak by settings shell variables (`VARIABLE=default` is shown):

- `DRY_RUN` (unset by default); if set to any value (also `0`, `false`, etc.), the start scripts print all executed commands instead of running. Useful for debugging/testing or just creating "template commands" for unique setups.
- `CONTAINER_ENGINE` (auto-detected) selects the container engine CLI. `install.sh` records the engine you picked in `$HOME/.config/iic-osic-tools/env`, which the start scripts source; without that file, `docker` is used if installed, otherwise `podman`. A value set in the environment always wins (e.g. `CONTAINER_ENGINE=podman ./start_x.sh`).
- `IIC_OSIC_TOOLS_SELINUX_LABEL` (unset by default) controls the SELinux workaround on Fedora/RHEL hosts, see [5.1.1 SELinux (Fedora, RHEL and Clones)](#511-selinux-fedora-rhel-and-clones).
- `IIC_OSIC_TOOLS_NO_STARTUP_CHECK` (unset by default); if set to any value, the start scripts skip the few seconds they otherwise spend verifying that the container is still running after the start.
- `DESIGNS=$HOME/eda/designs` (`DESIGNS=%USERPROFILE%\eda\designs` for `.bat`) sets the directory that holds your design files. This directory is mounted into the container on `/foss/designs`.
- `WEBSERVER_PORT=80` sets the port on which the Docker daemon will map the webserver port of the container to be reachable from localhost and the outside world. `0` disables the mapping. With rootless Podman (which cannot bind ports below 1024) the default is `8080`.
- `VNC_PORT=5901` sets the port on which the Docker daemon will map the VNC server port of the container to be reachable from localhost and the outside world. This is only required to access the UI with a different VNC client. `0` disabled the mapping.
- `DOCKER_REGISTRY="docker.io"` registry prefix used to fully qualify the image name (required for Podman, which does not resolve short names non-interactively). The prefix is skipped automatically when `DOCKER_USER` already names a registry (i.e. it contains a `.` or a `:`, or is `localhost`). Set it to `none` (the `.sh` scripts also accept `""`) to force unqualified names.
- `DOCKER_USER="hpretl"` username for the Docker Hub repository from which the images are pulled. Usually, no change is required. To pull from a private registry, either set it to the registry (e.g. `DOCKER_USER="myregistry.example.com:5000"`, optionally followed by a namespace such as `ghcr.io/hpretl`), or put the registry in `DOCKER_REGISTRY` and leave `DOCKER_USER` empty, which means the image sits at the root of the registry. Emptying it works as `DOCKER_USER=""` for the `.sh` scripts; for the `.bat` scripts `cmd` treats an empty variable as unset, so the default has to be emptied in the script itself.
- `DOCKER_IMAGE="iic-osic-tools"` Docker Hub image name to pull. Usually, no change is required.
- `DOCKER_TAG="latest"` Docker Hub image tag. By default, it pulls the latest version; this might be handy to change if you want to match a specific version set.
- `CONTAINER_USER=$(id -u)` (the current user's ID, `CONTAINER_USER=1000` for `.bat`) The user ID (and also group ID) is especially important on Linux and macOS because those are the IDs used to write files in the `DESIGNS` directory. For debugging/testing, the user and group ID can be set to `0` to gain root access inside the container.
- `CONTAINER_GROUP=$(id -g)` (the current user's group ID, `CONTAINER_GROUP=1000` for `.bat`)
- `CONTAINER_NAME="iic-osic-tools_xvnc_uid_"$(id -u)` (attaches the executing user's ID to the name on Unix, or only `CONTAINER_NAME="iic-osic-tools_xvnc` for `.bat`) is the name that is assigned to the container for easy identification. It is used to identify if a container exists and is running.
- `XKB_KEYBOARD_LAYOUT=us` sets the keyboard layout for the X server. This is necessary for KLayout shortcuts to behave propertly. E.g. you are a student at JKU using a German keyboard, you should set this to `at`.
- `XKB_KEYBOARD_VARIANT=` sets the keyboard variant for the X server. E.g. this could be set to `nodeadkeys`.

To overwrite the default settings, see [Overwriting Shell Variables](#44-overwriting-shell-variables)

### 4.3 Using a Local X-Server

This mode is recommended if the container is run on the local machine. It is significantly faster than VNC (as it renders the graphics locally), is more lightweight (no complete desktop environment is running), and integrates with the desktop (copy-paste, etc.). To start the container, run the following:

```bash
./start_x.sh
```

or

```terminal
.\start_x.bat
```

**Attention macOS users:** The X-server connection is automatically killed if there is a too-long idle period in the terminal (when this happens, it looks like a **crash** of the system). A **workaround** is to start a second terminal from the initial terminal that pops up when executing the start scripts `./start_x.sh` or `.\start_x.bat` and then start `htop` in the initial terminal. In this way, there is an ongoing display activity in the initial terminal, and as a positive side effect, the usage of the machine can be monitored. We are looking for a better long-term solution.

**Attention macOS users:** Please disable the *Enable VirtioFS accelerated directory sharing* setting available as "Beta Setting," as this will cause issues accessing the mounted drives! However, enabling the *VirtioFS* general setting works in Docker >v4.15.0!

**Attention macOS users:** On macOS the X11 mode talks to XQuartz over TCP (no local Unix socket or MIT-SHM across the Docker VM boundary), so it is bound by network round-trip latency. For redraw-heavy GUIs (e.g. KLayout, GTKWave), the VNC mode (`./start_vnc.sh`) renders inside the container and is usually noticeably faster and smoother.

#### 4.3.1 Variables for X11

The following environment variables are used for configuration:

- `DRY_RUN` (unset by default), if set to any value (also `0`, `false`, etc.), makes the start scripts print all executed commands instead of running. Useful for debugging/testing or just creating "template commands" for unique setups.
- `CONTAINER_ENGINE` (auto-detected) selects the container engine CLI. `install.sh` records the engine you picked in `$HOME/.config/iic-osic-tools/env`, which the start scripts source; without that file, `docker` is used if installed, otherwise `podman`. A value set in the environment always wins (e.g. `CONTAINER_ENGINE=podman ./start_x.sh`).
- `IIC_OSIC_TOOLS_SELINUX_LABEL` (unset by default) controls the SELinux workaround on Fedora/RHEL hosts, see [5.1.1 SELinux (Fedora, RHEL and Clones)](#511-selinux-fedora-rhel-and-clones).
- `IIC_OSIC_TOOLS_NO_STARTUP_CHECK` (unset by default); if set to any value, the start scripts skip the few seconds they otherwise spend verifying that the container is still running after the start.
- `DESIGNS=$HOME/eda/designs` (`DESIGNS=%USERPROFILE%\eda\designs` for `.bat`) sets the directory that holds your design files. This directory is mounted into the container on `/foss/designs`.
- `DOCKER_REGISTRY="docker.io"` registry prefix used to fully qualify the image name (required for Podman, which does not resolve short names non-interactively). The prefix is skipped automatically when `DOCKER_USER` already names a registry (i.e. it contains a `.` or a `:`, or is `localhost`). Set it to `none` (the `.sh` scripts also accept `""`) to force unqualified names.
- `DOCKER_USER="hpretl"` username for the Docker Hub repository from which the images are pulled. Usually, no change is required. To pull from a private registry, either set it to the registry (e.g. `DOCKER_USER="myregistry.example.com:5000"`, optionally followed by a namespace such as `ghcr.io/hpretl`), or put the registry in `DOCKER_REGISTRY` and leave `DOCKER_USER` empty, which means the image sits at the root of the registry. Emptying it works as `DOCKER_USER=""` for the `.sh` scripts; for the `.bat` scripts `cmd` treats an empty variable as unset, so the default has to be emptied in the script itself.
- `DOCKER_IMAGE="iic-osic-tools"` Docker Hub image name to pull. Usually, no change is required.
- `DOCKER_TAG="latest"` Docker Hub image tag. By default, it pulls the latest version; this might be handy to change if you want to match a specific Version set.
- `CONTAINER_USER=$(id -u)` (the current user's ID, `CONTAINER_USER=1000` for `.bat`) The user ID (and also group ID) is especially important on Linux and macOS because those are the IDs used to write files in the `DESIGNS` directory.
- `CONTAINER_GROUP=$(id -g)` (the current user's group ID, `CONTAINER_GROUP=1000` for `.bat`)
- `CONTAINER_NAME="iic-osic-tools_xserver_uid_"$(id -u)` (attaches the executing user's ID to the name on Unix, or only `CONTAINER_NAME="iic-osic-tools_xserver` for `.bat`) is the name that is assigned to the container for easy identification. It is used to identify if a container exists and is running.

#### 4.3.2 macOS and Windows-specific Variables

For Windows, WSLg (the graphical subsystem for WSL) is used, which is provided by a socket file inside the container. The display number is `:0`.
For Mac, the X11 server is accessed through TCP (defaults to `host.docker.internal:0`, `host.docker.internal` resolves to the host's IP address inside the docker containers, `:0` corresponds to display 0 which corresponds to TCP port 6000.).

Normally, it should not be necessary to modify these settings, but to control the server's address, you can set the following variable:

- `DISP` is the environment variable that is copied into the `DISPLAY` variable of the container.

For TCP based connections, access control might be modified. If the executable `xauth` is in `PATH`, the startup script automatically disables access control for localhost, so the X11 server is open for connections from the container. A warning will be shown if not, and you must disable access control.

#### 4.3.3 Linux-specific Variables

For Linux, the local X11 server is accessed through a Unix socket. There are multiple variables to control:

- `XSOCK=/tmp/.X11-unix` is typically the default location for the Unix sockets. The script will probe if it exists and, if yes, mount it into the container.
- `DISP` has the same function as macOS and Windows. It is copied to the container's `DISPLAY` variable. If it is not set, the value of `DISPLAY` from the host is copied.
- `XAUTH` defines the file that holds the cookies for authentication through the socket. If it is unset, the host's `XAUTHORITY` contents are used. If those are unset too, it will use `$HOME/.Xauthority`.

The defaults for these variables are tested on native X11 servers, X2Go sessions, and Wayland. The script copies and modifies the cookie from the`.Xauthority` file into a separate, temporary file. This file is then mounted into the container.

#### 4.3.4 Installing X11-Server

Everything should be ready on Linux with a desktop environment / UI (this setup has been tested on X11 and XWayland). For Windows, WSL should be updated to the latest version to provide WSLg (No additional X-Server needs to be installed, and it should be readily available on Windows 10 (from Build 19044) and Windows 11). For macOS, the installation of an X11 server is typically required. Due to the common protocol, every X11-server should work, although the following are tested:

- For macOS: [XQuartz](https://www.xquartz.org/) **Important:** Please enable *"Allow connections from network clients"* in the XQuartz preferences [CMD+","], tab *"Security"*

It is strongly recommended enabling OpenGL:

- The `start_x.sh` script will take care of that on macOS and set it according to configuration values. Only a manual restart of XQuartz is required after the script is run once (observe the output!).

### 4.4 Overwriting Shell Variables

#### 4.4.1 For the Linux/macOS Bash Scripts

There are multiple ways to configure the start scripts using Bash. Two of them are shown here. First, the variables can be set directly for each run of the script; they are not saved in the active session:

```bash
DESIGNS=/my/design/directory DOCKER_USER=another_user ./start_x.sh
```

The second variant is to set the variables in the current shell session (not persistent between shell restarts or shared between sessions):

```bash
export DESIGNS=/my/design/directory
export DOCKER_USER=another_user
./start_x.sh
```

As those variables are stored in your current shell session, you only have to set them once. After setting, you can directly run the scripts.

#### 4.4.2 For the Windows Batch Scripts

In `CMD` you can't set the variables directly when running the script. So for the `.bat` scripts, it is like the second variant for Bash scripts:

```batch
SET DESIGNS=\my\design\directory
SET DOCKER_USER=another_user
.\start_x.bat
```

### 4.5 Using as devcontainer

This is a new usage mode, that might fit your needs. [Devcontainers](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/containers) are a great way to provide a working build environment along your own project. It is supported by the [devcontainer](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers) extension in Visual Studio Code.

#### 4.5.1 Add it to project

Option 1: In Visual Studio Code, click the remote window icon on the left and then "Reopen in Container", "Add configuration to workspace". Enter "hpretl/iic-osic-tools-devcontainer" as template and add more features (probably not needed). It will then restart the IDE, download the image and start a terminal and mount the work folder into the image.

Option 2: Alternatively you can directly just create the configuration file `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json`:

```json
{
 "name": "IIC-OSIC-TOOLS",
 "image": "hpretl/iic-osic-tools-devcontainer:latest",
 "pullPolicy": "always"
}
```

Either way, the great thing is that you can now commit the file to repository and all developers will be asked if they want to reopen their development in this container, all they need is Docker and VS Code.

## 5. Using the Container with

The IIC-OSIC-TOOLS are meant to be beginner friendly. If you have limited knowledge of the tools involved (Docker, Podman, etc..), we suggest you follow [4. Quick Launch for Designers](#4-quick-launch-for-designers).
For container experts, there is also support for other container engines and additional tools, see the subsections below.

### 5.1 Podman

[Podman](https://podman.io/) is a demonless, OCI compatible container engine, that supports rootless containers to contain privileges inside the container. Podman is supported as a co-equal runtime by all start scripts: they auto-detect the installed engine (preferring `docker` if both are present; override with `CONTAINER_ENGINE=podman`), so no `podman-docker` compatibility alias and no script modification is needed. The interactive installers (`install.sh`/`install.ps1`) can install Podman instead of Docker.

The start scripts automatically handle the classic Podman pitfalls:

- In rootless mode on Linux, they add `--userns=keep-id` (unless a `--userns` option is already given via `DOCKER_EXTRA_PARAMS`), so the host user launching the container is mapped to the same UID/GID inside the container, preventing access issues between the container and mounted directories from the host. On macOS and Windows the bind mount passes through the Podman machine VM, which does the ID mapping itself, so `keep-id` is not added there.
- Since rootless mode cannot bind host ports below 1024, `start_vnc.sh` defaults the webserver port to `8080` instead of `80` (an explicitly set `WEBSERVER_PORT` below 1024 produces a warning). This also applies on macOS and Windows, where the Podman machine VM runs rootless by default and its `rootlessport` helper enforces the same limit.
- `start_vnc.sh` passes `--sysctl net.ipv4.ip_unprivileged_port_start=0` to Podman (rootful and rootless). Docker sets this namespaced sysctl in every container by default, Podman does not — without it, the noVNC webserver (which runs as a non-root user) cannot bind port 80 *inside* the container and the VNC mode fails.
- On SELinux hosts they add `--security-opt label=disable`, see [5.1.1 SELinux (Fedora, RHEL and Clones)](#511-selinux-fedora-rhel-and-clones).

So in most cases, simply running `./start_<mode>.sh` works out of the box with Podman.

By default, the container uses [nss_wrapper](https://cwrap.org/nss_wrapper.html) to fake a passwd/group entry (`designer`) for the arbitrary UID/GID the container is started with. With Podman and `--userns=keep-id` a real passwd entry for the current user already exists inside the container, so the wrapper can optionally be disabled by setting the container environment variable `IIC_OSIC_TOOLS_DISABLE_NSSWRAPPER` (any non-empty value):

`DOCKER_EXTRA_PARAMS="-e IIC_OSIC_TOOLS_DISABLE_NSSWRAPPER=1" ./start_<mode>.sh`

As a safety net, the request is ignored (with a warning) if no passwd entry exists for the container UID, because the TigerVNC server refuses to start without one ("vncserver: I do not know who you are").

> **Note on Docker Rootless Mode:** Docker in rootless mode has known limitations with X11/Wayland socket forwarding due to UID/GID mismatches between the host and container. There is no straightforward fix for Docker rootless mode, and we therefore recommend using Podman with `--userns=keep-id` as the preferred solution for rootless container operation.

#### 5.1.1 SELinux (Fedora, RHEL and Clones)

On hosts with SELinux the container process runs as `container_t`, while bind-mounted host paths keep their host label. SELinux then denies the container access to them: the X11 socket and the Wayland socket are labelled `user_tmp_t`, and the designs directory is labelled `user_home_t`. This affects every launch mode:

| Mode | Symptom without the workaround |
| --- | --- |
| `start_x.sh` | No terminal window appears, and the container exits a few seconds after the start. |
| `start_vnc.sh` | The desktop comes up, but `/foss/designs` is inaccessible. |
| `start_jupyter.sh` | The notebook server comes up, but `/foss/designs` is inaccessible. |
| `start_shell.sh` | The shell works, but `/foss/designs` is inaccessible. (That GUI tools stay in text mode here is by design, this mode forwards no X11/Wayland socket.) |

The matching denial in `sudo ausearch -m avc -ts recent` looks like this (see [issue #352](https://github.com/iic-jku/IIC-OSIC-TOOLS/issues/352)):

```text
avc: denied { write } for pid=23821 comm="xfce4-terminal" name="X0" dev="tmpfs" ino=39
scontext=system_u:system_r:container_t:s0:c546,c994
tcontext=unconfined_u:object_r:user_tmp_t:s0 tclass=sock_file permissive=0
```

The start scripts therefore add `--security-opt label=disable` whenever the host kernel has SELinux enabled, in enforcing as well as in permissive mode. This applies to Podman and to Docker (Docker only labels containers when the daemon runs with `"selinux-enabled": true`, but where labelling is off the option is simply a no-op), and it is skipped if `DOCKER_EXTRA_PARAMS` already carries a `--security-opt label=…` option.

This switches off SELinux **type enforcement for this one container**. Seccomp, capabilities, cgroups, the user namespace and rootless mode are unaffected, and nothing on the host is relabelled. The alternative, relabelling the mounted paths with `:z`, is not an option here: `/tmp/.X11-unix` and `/run/user/$UID` belong to the host session, relabelling them would let *any* container talk to your X server, and both live on tmpfs, so it would have to be repeated after every login.

The behavior can be changed with `IIC_OSIC_TOOLS_SELINUX_LABEL`:

| Value | Effect |
| --- | --- |
| unset (default) | Auto-detect, and add `--security-opt label=disable` on SELinux hosts. |
| set to empty | Never add a label option. |
| set to a value | Always add `--security-opt label=<value>`, e.g. `type:container_runtime_t`. |

To keep type enforcement on instead, switch the workaround off and relabel the designs directory by hand (this makes `/foss/designs` work, but **not** the X11 mode):

```bash
export IIC_OSIC_TOOLS_SELINUX_LABEL=
chcon -Rt container_file_t "$HOME/eda/designs"   # undo with: restorecon -R -v "$HOME/eda/designs"
```

Container options are fixed when a container is created, so a container created before this fix cannot pick the option up on restart. Press `r` at the prompt to remove it (or run `podman rm iic-osic-tools_xserver_uid_$(id -u)`), then start the script again to re-create it. With an older checkout, the option can be passed by hand:

```bash
DOCKER_EXTRA_PARAMS="--security-opt label=disable" ./start_x.sh
```

### 5.2 Distrobox

[Distrobox](https://distrobox.it) is a *fancy wrapper around Podman or Docker to create and start containers highly integrated with the hosts*. Like the `start_x` scripts, Distrobox manages the forwarding of X11/Wayland to the container, but allows for even more tight integration, by also forwarding the users home directory, and seamlessly integration other services like the systemd journal, D-Bus etc...
Distrobox specifically mentions that its main focus lies on integration, and not on sandboxing and security.

The IIC-OSIC-TOOLS support the usage of Distrobox, even though the usage is slightly different, compared to the start scripts. Noteably, the /headless is not the in-container-user's home directory, and /foss/designs will not be mounted. But `/home/<username>` will have full access to the users home directory.

A IIC-OSIC-TOOLS Distrobox can be started and accessed with:

`distrobox create -n iic-osic-tools -i hpretl/iic-osic-tools:latest`
`distrobox enter iic-osic-tools`
