# every dependency already provided by the base image (scipy, pandas, ...) as
# a shadow copy in this layer, growing the image by several 100 MB; (2) pip
# must honour the APT-provided python3-gmsh as satisfying the gmsh

#
# That is the point, because the flag in PIP_FLAGS only covers the outer pip.
# It is not always handed down to the nested pip that PEP 517 build isolation
# runs to fetch a package's build dependencies. The venvs below are the clearest
# case: "python3 -m venv" bootstraps the pip bundled with CPython (24.0), which
# does not forward the flag, so building the git+ packages pulls setuptools,
# virtualenv, distlib, dulwich, numpy, ... straight into $HOME/.cache/pip. With
# HOME=/headless during the build that left ~55 MB of download residue in the
# image. An environment variable IS inherited by those nested invocations.

# The four packages pulling in PySide6 (chipify, snp2le, gds2palace, setupEM)
# only use QtWidgets/QtCore/QtGui/QtSvg, all of which live in
# PySide6-Essentials. The PySide6-Addons half (~340 MB, dominated by a 254 MB
# embedded Chromium in QtWebEngine, plus Qt3D/Quick3D/Designer/Multimedia) is
# not imported by anything in the image, so remove it.
#
# Catch: the Essentials and Addons wheels BOTH ship the shared top-level PySide6
# files (PySide6/__init__.py, _config.py, __feature__.py, _git_pyside_version.py),
# and pip does no cross-package refcounting -- so "pip uninstall PySide6-Addons"
# also deletes the PySide6/__init__.py that Essentials still needs. That leaves
# PySide6 importable only as a namespace package with no __version__, which breaks
# matplotlib's Qt backend ("cannot import name '__version__' from 'PySide6'") and
# every GUI built on it. So force-reinstall Essentials afterwards to rewrite the
# shared files (--no-deps stops Addons from being pulled back in).
#
# The PySide6 meta-package is kept on purpose: gds2palace and setupEM depend on it
# by name, so removing it would leave their dependency unsatisfied. pip check will
# note the meta-package wants Addons, which is harmless at runtime.
