"""Teach VACASK's sg13cmos5ltovc.py about the CMOS5L-own OSDI devices it misses.

VACASK ships the CMOS5L -> VACASK converter as python/sg13cmos5ltovc.py, and it
names the devices it converts in two hardcoded lists:

    tech_files = [
        ( "cap_cmomi.lib", 0, 0 ),
        ...
    ]
    included_va_files = [
        ( "cap_cmomi/cap_cmomi.va",     [ "-D__NGSPICE" ] ),
    ]

The CMOS5L PDK is installed from its default branch rather than from a pinned
commit (see install_ihp_cmos5l.sh), so it grows devices between VACASK releases.
When it does, the converted PDK breaks in a way that is easy to miss: the model
wrapper .lib is never converted and its Verilog-A is never compiled, yet the
corner file that includes it *is* converted verbatim. Every VACASK deck that
pulls in that corner then dies on a missing include, even one that does not use
the new device at all.

That is exactly what cap_cmomf, the metal fringe MoM capacitor added to the PDK
on 2026-08-11, did to the whole CMOS5L capacitor path: cornerCAP.lib gained an
".include cap_cmomf.lib" in every one of its sections, so a deck as small as

    include "cornerCAP.lib" section=cap_typ

no longer loads (regression test 29).

Rather than pin the device name, this patch derives it from the PDK: every
CMOS5L-own Verilog-A module (a real directory <name>/<name>.va under
libs.tech/verilog-a -- psp103 and r3_cmc are symlinks into SG13G2 and are
handled by the converter's osdi_symlinks) is added to included_va_files, and its
ngspice wrapper libs.tech/ngspice/models/<name>.lib, if there is one, to
tech_files. The next device the PDK adds is therefore covered without a change
here.

Devices the converter already lists are left alone, so this is a no-op once
VACASK catches up, and it is idempotent. If either list cannot be found the
patch fails instead of silently doing nothing: that means upstream restructured
the converter and this helper needs a look.

Note what this deliberately does NOT do: a new device whose .lib writes its
subckt defaults symbolically (".param none=0 same=1 double=2" plus "feed=double"
on the .subckt line, the way cap_cmomi does) is still locked to its default in
VACASK, which treats such a parameter as derived and rejects every override.
Upstream patches that one case by hand in sg13cmos5ltovc.py's "patches" table.
cap_cmomf has literal defaults and needs nothing; test 29 is the guard if a
future device does not.
