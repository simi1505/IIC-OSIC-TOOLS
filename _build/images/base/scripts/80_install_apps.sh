# noVNC is installed from upstream rather than from the `novnc` apt package, which on
# noble is 1.3.0 (October 2021).
#
# Up to 1.5.0 the client tracks the pressed mouse buttons as incremental state: the mask
# it sends to the VNC server is OR-ed with the button on `mousedown` and cleared again on
# `mouseup`, and nothing ever re-synchronises it. A `mouseup` that never reaches the page
# therefore leaves the bit set and the X server keeps the button held down for good --
# not even a page reload clears it, and no later click does either, because the mask is
# only ever adjusted by the matching release. Releasing outside the browser window and
# having the release swallowed by a native context menu are both easy to hit with a
# right-button drag, which is exactly KLayout's zoom box. A button stuck down also breaks
# window handling: X keeps an implicit pointer grab until all buttons are released, so
# every later click goes to the window that was under the cursor when the button went
# down, and the window manager never gets to focus or raise anything else.
#
# Upstream fixed this in 1.6.0 by deriving the mask from `MouseEvent.buttons`, the
# browser's authoritative view, on every mouse event, so a lost release self-corrects.
# A native VNC viewer is unaffected either way -- it reads the real button state from the
# OS instead of reconstructing it from a lossy DOM event stream.

# websockify doubles as the web server for the client, and its request handler derives from
# Python's SimpleHTTPRequestHandler, which sends `Last-Modified` but no `Cache-Control`.
# Browsers then fall back to heuristic freshness -- roughly a tenth of the age of the file --
# and the client is served from cache without ever asking the server. The apt package's files
# carried their 2021 upstream mtimes, so a browser that had opened the session once kept
# running that copy for months across image upgrades. `no-cache` means "revalidate before
# use", not "do not store", so the cost is one conditional request per file, answered with a
# 304, on a connection that is usually localhost.
#
# `novnc_proxy` resolves websockify through `type -P`, so a wrapper earlier in PATH is picked
# up without patching either package. The wrapper drives the library directly, so it cannot
# recurse into itself.
#
# The missing headers are tracked upstream as https://github.com/novnc/websockify/issues/626;
# drop this wrapper once websockify sends `Cache-Control` itself.
