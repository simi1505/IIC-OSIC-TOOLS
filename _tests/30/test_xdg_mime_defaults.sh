# Check that every design file type opens in the right application.
#
# Two things have to hold for a double click in Thunar, an `xdg-open`, or a
# button in sak-open to reach the intended tool:
#
#   1. the extension resolves to the intended MIME type, which for the EDA
#      formats comes from skel/usr/share/mime/packages/iic-osic-tools-types.xml
#      and only works if update-mime-database ran after that file was copied in;
#   2. that MIME type has a default application, which comes from
#      skel/usr/share/applications/mimeapps.list.
#
# Both have failed silently before: the MIME package shipped uncompiled (a .sch
# resolved as text/plain), .gds.gz lost to the generic "*.gz" glob and opened in
# the archive manager, and the many types no installed application claims had no
# handler at all.
#
# The test also asserts that sak-open.py knows no file type this list does not
# cover, so extending the one without the other fails here.
#
# .mag.gz is deliberately absent: magic cannot read a gzipped layout, so neither
# the MIME package nor sak-open.py claims one.
