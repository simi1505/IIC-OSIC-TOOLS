# KLayout PCell smoke/regression harness (driven by test_klayout_pcells.sh).
#
# For the active PDK (taken from $PDK) this script:
#   - discovers every PCell library the PDK registers in KLayout (skipping
#     KLayout's built-in "Basic"/"DEFAULT" libraries),
#   - instantiates every PCell once with its declared default parameters,
#   - classifies the result as OK / EMPTY / ERROR:
#       OK    - the cell (incl. its hierarchy) contains at least one shape
#       EMPTY - instantiation succeeded but produced no geometry at all
#       ERROR - create_cell raised a Python exception
#   - compares the outcome against the per-PDK baseline in EXPECTED below and
#     exits non-zero on any deviation (a good PCell breaking, a known-bad one
#     changing verdict, or the PCell inventory drifting).
#
# Run standalone (bash syntax) after `source sak-pdk-script.sh <pdk>`:
#   cd <writable-dir> && klayout -zz -r check_pcells.py
# A writable current directory is required: the gdsfactory-based sky130A and
# gf180mcuD PCells write a temporary GDS into the CWD while producing geometry.
