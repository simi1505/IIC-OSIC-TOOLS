# IIC-OSIC-TOOLS Release Notes

This document summarizes the most important changes of the individual releases of the `IIC-OSIC-TOOLS` Docker container.

## 2026.08

* [Adding] `sak-gds-xor.py` to XOR two layouts (GDS2/OASIS) with KLayout and write the differing geometry to an output layout, for comparing two revisions of a layout or a signoff database against its source.
* [Adding] `sak-open`, a launcher that scans a design tree (`$DESIGNS` or a given root, skipping build-output directories such as `runs/` by default) and puts up a window with one button per design file, grouped by directory: schematics and symbols open in `xschem`, layouts (`.gds`/`.oas`, also gzipped) in KLayout edit mode, `.mag` in Magic, `.vcd`/`.fst`/`.gtkw` in GTKWave, ngspice `.raw` in `gaw`, and everything textual — RTL, SPICE decks, Makefiles, scripts — in the editor, each launched in the file's own directory so the tool finds its collateral. The tree is rescanned periodically, so files created by a running flow appear on their own; the list can be narrowed by file type and name, hovering a button reports size, age, symlink target and writability, and the right mouse button offers a terminal in the file's directory (command overridable via `SAK_OPEN_TERMINAL`) or the file's path on the clipboard.
* [Adding] `sak-render.py` to render a layout (GDS2/OASIS, optionally gzipped) to PNG images off-screen, drawn with the layer colors and stipples of the PDK's own KLayout layer properties and cropped to the drawn geometry, on a white and a black background (or just one of them). All four packaged technologies are supported through `-t`, defaulting to `$PDK`: `ihp-sg13g2`, `ihp-sg13cmos5l`, `gf180mcuD` and `sky130A`. By default every physical mask layer is rendered (wells, implants, active, poly, contacts, the metal/via stack, MIM caps and the pad opening), while text, pins, markers and fill/dummy shapes stay hidden. `-l`/`-x` select or hide layers by group (`metal`, `via`, `filler`, ...), by name (`m1`, `TopMetal2`, `li1`, ..., or any name from the `.lyp` file), or by GDS `layer/datatype` numbers. `-l +filler` adds the fill shapes for the classic chip-shot look, `--list` prints everything a technology offers, and image width, height and oversampling are selectable.
* [Adding] the `unifont` package, so schematics, netlists and terminal output containing unicode symbols render instead of showing boxes.
* [Adding] a complete logo asset pack in `_logo/` (PNG and SVG, color/mono/reversed, horizontal and stacked), which is now used for the project branding described below.
* [Update] VACASK support for the IHP `SG13CMOS5L` PDK is completed, and the conversion now comes from VACASK itself: upstream added an `ihp-sg13cmos5l` converter (`sg13cmos5ltovc.py`, see [VACASK issue #94](https://codeberg.org/arpadbuermen/VACASK/issues/94)) during this release cycle, so the in-house conversion — model conversion, OSDI compilation of the CMOS5L-own Verilog-A, the common include, `.vacaskrc.toml`, and the VACASK glue (`spectre_format=` lines, VACASK section, corner set) on the 80 CMOS5L-own `xschem` symbols — is dropped in its favor. The upstream conversion is also more complete, since it converts CMOS5L's own standard-cell and I/O netlists instead of pointing those includes back at `ihp-sg13g2`. Three defects found in the upstream converter — models that CMOS5L symlinks from `ihp-sg13g2` were converted into (and partly over) the SG13G2 tree, the `cap_cmomi` `feed` default stayed symbolic and therefore not overridable (see below), and the `xschem` corner menu was installed from the SG13G2 file, listing the `cornerHBT.lib` that CMOS5L does not have — were reported and are fixed upstream, so no local fixups remain. One local addition is kept on top: the `xschem` "Add VACASK models symbol" menu also lists the `cornerDIO` and `cornerPNP` corner sections, which upstream omits (for `SG13G2` as well), so diode and `pnpMPA` designs get their corners too.
* [Update] `xschem` bumped past the upstream fix for the headless `tcleval` focus call ([xschem issue #494](https://github.com/StefanSchippers/xschem/issues/494)); the local patch guarding that call is removed again.
* [Update] `LibMan` bumped past the upstream fix for the Qt6 build ([LibMan issue #5](https://github.com/IHP-GmbH/LibMan/issues/5)): upstream replaced `QString::SkipEmptyParts`, which Qt6 removed, with the `Qt::SkipEmptyParts` spelling available since Qt 5.14, so the local patch that did the same substitution at build time is removed again.
* [Update] the Yosys stack (`yosys`, `eqy`, `sby`, `mcy`) is held back at `v0.67`. Yosys `v0.68` removed the `-fast` option of the `abc` pass, which LibreLane's `pyosys` synthesis script calls unconditionally, so every LibreLane flow would die in synthesis. The pin is lifted once LibreLane upstream stops calling it.
* [Update] various tool and Python package version bumps: `bender`, `ghdl`, `iverilog`, `kepler-formal`, KLayout (`v0.30.10`), Magic (`8.3.680`), `nextpnr`, `nvc` (`r1.22.1`), `open_pdks`, `openEMS`, OpenROAD, `palace`, SiliconCompiler, `slang` and the `slang-yosys-plugin`, `spike`, `uv` (`0.12.2`), VACASK, `verible`, and `xschem`.
* [Changing] the browser (noVNC) session now uses the full noVNC client instead of the stripped-down `vnc_lite.html` demo page that had been served from `/` since the container's ConSol ancestry. The control bar this adds provides clipboard transfer in both directions, fullscreen, ctrl-alt-del, and connection settings — none of which the lite client has. The advertised URL is unchanged (`http://localhost:<WEBSERVER_PORT>/?password=<pw>` still connects straight through), and the container desktop now resizes to the browser window by default; the "Scaling Mode" setting overrides that and is remembered.
* [Changing] noVNC is installed from upstream `v1.7.0` instead of the `novnc` package Ubuntu ships, which is still `1.3.0` from October 2021 and carries the mouse-button defect described below. Besides that fix this brings four years of upstream work, most visibly the redesigned control bar. Client behavior is now configured through the `defaults.json`/`mandatory.json` files that noVNC gained in `1.6.0` rather than through query parameters injected by the redirect page: the desktop still follows the browser window by default and the "Scaling Mode" setting still overrides it, and the connection target is pinned to the address the page was loaded from, so a host/port left over from an earlier session can no longer win over the port actually in use.
* [Changing] the project branding is refreshed with the new logo: the `README` header, the noVNC favicon and browser-tab title, the JupyterLab favicons (including the inverted "busy" variants, so the kernel-activity cue is kept), and the desktop background, which is now scaled rather than centered and therefore no longer cropped on narrow screens. The desktop backdrop color is set to `#22272E` — the color configured until now was in a format `xfdesktop` 4.18 ignores, so the desktop always fell back to the stock blue.
* [Changing] the desktop terminal is `xfce4-terminal` instead of `gnome-terminal`, which is what the right-click menu, the panel launcher, `Ctrl+Alt+T` and Thunar's "Open Terminal Here" now open. `gnome-terminal`'s D-Bus-activated factory frequently failed to map a window inside the container, leaving 10x10 leader windows, accumulating `gnome-terminal --wait` processes, and the XFCE error dialog "Failed to execute default Terminal Emulator / Input/output error". `gnome-terminal` is purged; `xterm` is deliberately kept, because `xschem` spawns it for simulations.
* [Changing] double-clicking a file in Thunar (or handing it to `xdg-open`) now opens the matching tool for the common file types of this image: a system-wide `mimeapps.list` and expanded custom MIME type definitions route schematics, layouts (including gzipped ones), `.mag`, `.cdl`, netlists, waveforms and Makefiles to their viewers and editors, and desktop entries for GTKWave and `gaw` are added. ngspice `.raw` files get their own MIME type — upstream the extension belongs to a camera raw image format — and open in `gaw`, whose shipped desktop file was unreachable (installed off `XDG_DATA_DIRS`, and without a file argument in its `Exec`). An audit of ~90 extensions a user of this image might double-click found 21 without any handler; 15 are now mapped — scripts, logs and configuration formats to the editor, `.ps`/`.eps` to `gv`, whose desktop file claims a MIME type nothing resolves to — and the `ristretto` image viewer and the `zathura` PDF viewer are installed. New regression test 30 validates the extension → MIME type → application resolution end to end and keeps it aligned with `sak-open`.
* [Changing] `xschem` now requires the Ctrl key for zooming and panning inside graph (waveform) widgets (`graph_use_ctrl_key`), so the mouse wheel keeps zooming the schematic when the pointer happens to be over a graph. The setting is applied centrally in the system-wide `xschemrc` and is therefore active for all PDKs; the `Options` menu toggle can still switch it back per session.
* [Changing] `Veryl` now works out of the box: `verylup setup` runs at image build time, so `veryl` and `veryl-ls` are on `PATH` and the default toolchain is preinstalled, while the toolchain tree stays user-writable for `verylup install`/`pin` at runtime. Previously `verylup setup` failed for non-root users with `EPERM`. The `XDG_DATA_HOME=/headless/.data-default` override is dropped along with it, so build time and runtime resolve the same spec-default path (`~/.local/share`).
* [Changing] the container startup was audited across all three operating modes: `start_shell.sh` defaults `DISPLAY` to the host gateway on macOS and to the host `DISPLAY` on Linux instead of a dead `:0`; the VNC session no longer starts `ssh-agent`, `gpg-agent`, `xiccd` or the `udisks2` GVfs volume monitor, none of which are useful in the container (the `tumbler` thumbnailer stays — Thunar and Ristretto ask for it either way and show an error dialog when it is missing); `~/.Xauthority` is pre-created; the X11-mode terminal runs under `dbus-run-session` so `xfconfd` works; and known-harmless noVNC/GTK/dbus messages are filtered out of the container log.
* [Changing] `PyOPUS` is ported from PyQt5 to PySide6. Its threaded plotting (`pyopus.plotter`, used by the plotting demos) works unchanged; the `pyog` project GUI is removed, as its table models rely on PyQt5-specific virtual dispatch.
* [Changing] the Liberty files in `libs.ref` of all packaged PDKs are now also provided gzipped as `.lib.gz`, and the `librelane`/`openlane`/`qflow` configurations shipped with the PDKs reference the compressed files. All Liberty-reading tools in the image (`yosys`/ABC, OpenROAD, OpenSTA, `librelane`, `kepler-formal`) handle `.lib.gz` transparently. **Deprecation notice:** the uncompressed `.lib` files are kept alongside for the next few releases and will then be removed, so please migrate your own flows and configurations to the `.lib.gz` paths. The SPICE model libraries in `libs.tech/{ngspice,xyce,vacask,qucs-s}`, which also use the `.lib` extension, are not affected and stay uncompressed.
* [Fix] the PDK operating-point annotation symbols (`annotate_fet_params.sym`, `annotate_bip_params.sym`) showed `NaN` in every field in `2026.07`, affecting IHP `display_fet_params`/`display_bip_params` and sky130 `sky130_display_fet_params`. An upstream reentrancy guard in `translate()` was held across the Tcl evaluation, so a `tcleval(...)` callback that itself calls `xschem translate` — which is exactly what these annotators do — got an empty string back, losing the model name. `xschem` is bumped past `f583f470`, which releases the guard before the Tcl evaluation and keeps it only around the token parsing (see [issue #342](https://github.com/iic-jku/IIC-OSIC-TOOLS/issues/342) and [xschem issue #460](https://codeberg.org/stef_xschem/xschem/issues/460)).
* [Fix] `xschem` no longer asks whether embedded Tcl scripts may be executed (`xschem_execute_scripts yes` in the shipped user `xschemrc`), which the PDK launcher symbols and `tcleval()` attributes need in order to work silently.
* [Fix] `start_vnc.sh` now detects rootless Podman on macOS and Windows as well. The detection was gated on Linux, but the Podman machine VM is rootless by default too and its `rootlessport` helper refuses to publish host ports below 1024, so `WEBSERVER_PORT` stayed at `80` and container creation failed with "rootlessport cannot expose privileged port 80"; it now auto-selects `8080` there as well (`--userns=keep-id` stays Linux-only). A failed container start also reports the error and exits non-zero instead of still printing the VNC URL.
* [Fix] the start scripts prefixed `DOCKER_REGISTRY` to the image name even when `DOCKER_USER` already named a registry, so pulling from a private registry was impossible since `2026.07`: the `.bat` scripts produced `docker.io/myregistry:5000/iic-osic-tools:latest`, which the engine rejects with `invalid reference format` because a repository path component may not contain a colon, and the `.sh` scripts needed `DOCKER_REGISTRY=""` as a workaround. The prefix is now skipped automatically when `DOCKER_USER` contains a `.` or a `:`, or is `localhost` — the same rule the reference parser uses — so `DOCKER_USER="myregistry:5000"` is all that is needed. `DOCKER_REGISTRY=none` forces unqualified names on all start scripts (the `.sh` scripts still accept `DOCKER_REGISTRY=""`), and the `.bat` scripts gained that switch, which they previously lacked entirely because `cmd` cannot distinguish an empty variable from an unset one. An empty `DOCKER_USER` is also accepted now and means the image sits at the root of the registry, so `DOCKER_REGISTRY="myregistry:5000"` with an empty `DOCKER_USER` works as well; it previously produced a double slash (`myregistry:5000//iic-osic-tools:latest`), which is rejected for the same reason.
* [Fix] a mouse button could get stuck down in the browser (noVNC) session, most easily the right one, and stay stuck: KLayout kept drawing its right-drag zoom box, and because X holds an implicit pointer grab until every button is released, each later click went to the window that was under the cursor when the button went down, so window focus and raising stopped working too. Up to noVNC `1.5.0` the button mask sent to the VNC server is incremental state — OR-ed on `mousedown`, cleared on `mouseup` — and is never re-synchronised, so a `mouseup` that never reaches the page leaves the bit set for good. Releasing outside the browser window and having the release swallowed by a native context menu both do that, and both are easy to hit with a right-button drag. Neither a later click nor a page reload cleared it. Upstream fixed this in `1.6.0` by deriving the mask from `MouseEvent.buttons` on every event, so a lost release now self-corrects; a native VNC viewer was never affected, as it reads the real button state from the OS.
* [Fix] forcing VNC mode by passing `-V`/`--vnc` to the container entrypoint, as its own `--help` documents, killed the container a moment after the session came up. That flag skips the UI auto-detection, which is the only place that set `DISPLAY`, so `vncserver` picked a display number of its own while the rest of the startup script still talked to an empty `DISPLAY`; `setxkbmap` then failed with "Cannot open display" and `set -e` brought everything down. `DISPLAY` now defaults to `:1` whenever the VNC session is started without one, and a `DISPLAY` provided by the caller is still honored, so the session can be put on another display number. The start scripts were never affected — they rely on the auto-detection, which did set it.
* [Fix] the browser no longer serves a stale noVNC client out of its cache after an image upgrade. `websockify`, which doubles as the web server for the client, derives from Python's `SimpleHTTPRequestHandler` and sends `Last-Modified` but no `Cache-Control`, so browsers fall back to heuristic freshness — about a tenth of the age of the file. The files of the `novnc` package carried their 2021 upstream mtimes, which made that window months long, and a browser that had opened the session once kept running that copy across upgrades without ever asking the server. Every response now carries `Cache-Control: no-cache`, which asks for revalidation rather than forbidding storage, so the cost is one conditional request per file, answered with a `304`. **Note:** a browser that already cached the old client cannot learn about this from the server, so please reload the noVNC page once bypassing the cache (`Ctrl+Shift+R`, `Cmd+Shift+R` on macOS) after upgrading to this image.
* [Fix] the `[INFO] noVNC HTML client started` line printed by the container omitted the web server port, which is misleading whenever `WEBSERVER_PORT` is not `80` — that is, by default under rootless Podman, including on macOS and Windows. The `README` instructions had the same omission.
* [Fix] `XDG_RUNTIME_DIR` is created per user at container startup as `/tmp/runtime-<uid>` with mode `0700`, instead of the shipped root-owned, world-writable `/tmp/runtime-default` shared by every UID. That violated the XDG specification, which `dbus-daemon` and others verify — dbus warned and disabled its transient service directory. An externally provided `XDG_RUNTIME_DIR` (for example WSLg's) is respected, `CONTAINER_XDG_RUNTIME_DIR` still overrides explicitly, and `start_x.sh` mounts a forwarded Wayland socket at the neutral path `/tmp/host-wayland`, which the profile script links into the per-user directory.
* [Fix] `PySide6` was left broken by the removal of `PySide6-Addons`: both wheels ship the shared top-level `PySide6` files and `pip` does no cross-package reference counting, so uninstalling Addons deleted the `PySide6/__init__.py` that Essentials still needs. `PySide6` then imported as a namespace package without `__version__`, breaking matplotlib's Qt backend and every GUI on top of it, including `chipify` and `snp2le`. `PySide6-Essentials` is now force-reinstalled at the already resolved version, so it cannot pull a version mismatching the installed `shiboken6`.
* [Fix] `charlib` and `cir2py` are installed as wrappers that unset `PYTHONPATH` before launching their venv entry points, so the container-wide Python path no longer shadows CharLib's pinned `PySpice` fork; binaries from Python virtualenvs are no longer symlinked into `$TOOLS/bin`.
* [Fix] the `feed` parameter of the IHP `SG13CMOS5L` `cap_cmomi` MoM capacitor can be set again in VACASK. The ngspice model writes the default symbolically (`.param none=0 same=1 double=2`, then `feed=double`) and the model conversion carried that over verbatim; VACASK treats a subckt parameter whose default references another parameter as derived and rejects every override with `Parameter 'feed' not found.`. That silently locked the device to `feed=double` and broke the `xschem` → VACASK path outright, since the `spectre_format=` line always emits `feed=<token>`. The converter — now upstream's `sg13cmos5ltovc.py`, where this was reported and fixed — patches the default to a literal during conversion, and new regression test 29 covers `cap_cmomi` in both ngspice and VACASK against the capacitance the KLayout PCell prints in its own `C=` label.
* [Fix] selecting the PDK at container start (`-e PDK=<pdk>`) now also selects the matching standard cell library. `STD_CELL_LIBRARY` was hardcoded to `sg13g2_stdcell` in the profile script, so every PDK other than `ihp-sg13g2` — `ihp-sg13cmos5l`, `sky130A`/`B`, `gf180mcuC`/`D` — silently kept pointing at the IHP `SG13G2` cells; `GF_PDK_OPTION` was likewise left unset for `gf180mcu`, where KLayout then warns and assumes `D`. Both are now derived from `$PDK` using the same mapping `sak-pdk-script.sh` applies when switching the PDK of a running session, and an explicitly provided value still wins, so a custom or unpackaged library can be selected as before.
* [Fix] the KLayout PCell libraries of both IHP PDKs no longer break when two KLayout processes run at the same time. The libraries preprocess every PCell module into `$TMPDIR/<module>_pre.py` and delete it again, using the bare module name — and `SG13G2` and `SG13CMOS5L` ship the same module names (`rfnmos_code`, `bondpad_code`, …). On the shared `/tmp` two concurrent processes therefore wrote and deleted the *same* file, and the loser died with `FileNotFoundError` while importing it. Since that exception escapes the library constructor called from `autorun.lym`, the PDK registered *no* PCell at all, not just a broken one — two KLayout windows, or an LVS/DRC job next to an interactive session, were enough. Ten concurrent loads reproduced it reliably; the file now carries the process ID and its removal tolerates a file that is already gone. Regression test 27 additionally gives each PDK run its own `TMPDIR`.
* [Fix] the `gf180mcuD` `efuse` PCell produces geometry instead of an empty cell. Two upstream bugs: `draw_efuse()` was called without its required `device_name` argument (unused in the body), and it read `efuse.gds` from `/home/$USER/.klayout/pymacros/cells/efuse`, where nothing ever installs it — the GDS ships next to the module. Both cell libraries are patched at PDK-install time.
* [Fix] instantiating IHP PCells no longer floods the console. `sealring` obtained the PDK version by shelling out to `git` inside the PDK tree, which carries no `.git`, so every instantiation printed `fatal: not a git repository` and labelled the seal ring `PDK version: Unknown`; it now reads the `COMMIT` file the installer writes next to the PDK. `isolbox` defaulted its length and width to `3u` while its own callback clamps both to `3.6u`, warning on every default instantiation; the tech parameter is corrected (the neighbouring area and perimeter defaults already assumed `3.6u`, and the geometry is unchanged). The ~35 `Box.destroy: already destroyed!` warnings per run — the CNI foreground booleans consume their operands and several PCells destroy them again, which is a no-op — are demoted to a verbosity-gated level.
* [Fix] `sak-pin-reorder.py` matches the `.subckt` card case-insensitively. SPICE cards are case-insensitive and netlisters disagree — `xschem` and Magic write `.subckt`, KLayout-PEX writes `.SUBCKT` — so every `kpex`-extracted netlist failed with "No .subckt line found in the netlist file". The spelling found in the source file is carried through to the rewritten header.
* [Fix] the container now works on SELinux hosts (Fedora, RHEL and clones). The container process runs as `container_t`, while the bind-mounted X11/Wayland sockets keep the host label `user_tmp_t` and the designs directory keeps `user_home_t`, so SELinux denied access to both: `start_x.sh` never showed a window and the container exited a few seconds after the start, and `/foss/designs` was inaccessible in every mode. The start scripts now add `--security-opt label=disable` when the host kernel has SELinux enabled, which switches off type enforcement for that container only — seccomp, capabilities, the user namespace and rootless mode are unaffected, and nothing on the host is relabelled. Relabelling the mounts instead is not an option, since the GUI sockets belong to the host session. `IIC_OSIC_TOOLS_SELINUX_LABEL` selects a different label option or, exported empty, switches the workaround off; see [issue #352](https://github.com/iic-jku/IIC-OSIC-TOOLS/issues/352) and section 5.1.1 of the README. Container options are fixed at create time, so an existing container has to be removed and re-created, which the scripts now warn about.
* [Fix] a container that dies during startup no longer fails silently. `start_x.sh`, `start_vnc.sh` and `start_jupyter.sh` start it detached and returned without checking, so the above SELinux failure produced no output at all. They now watch the container for a few seconds after `run`/`start`, print the tail of its log together with a hint when it stops, and no longer advertise a VNC or Jupyter URL for a container that already exited (`IIC_OSIC_TOOLS_NO_STARTUP_CHECK` skips the wait). In the container, an unreachable X server is reported with the display, the authority file and the likely causes instead of a bare warning.
* [Fix] `install.sh` records the container engine you picked in `$HOME/.config/iic-osic-tools/env`, which the start scripts source. The choice was previously used for the installation only, so on a machine that also has a `docker` CLI (a leftover, or the `podman-docker` alias) the start scripts silently auto-detected Docker again. A value set in the environment still wins.
* [Build] moved the build-only compiler toolchains (`clang`/LLVM, `gnat`, `gfortran`) from the runtime image to `base-dev`, and dropped the unused `ant` and `binutils-gold`; the runtime image keeps GCC, `mold`, and only the matching shared libraries (`libllvm18`, `libgnat-13`), which reduces the image by about 300 MB.
* [Build] consolidated the Python Qt bindings on `PySide6`, saving about 115 MB. `python3-pyqt5` and `python3-pyqt6` are gone from the runtime image (PyQt5 stays in `base-dev`, where the PyOPUS build needs it), the Qt libraries they used to drag in are now requested explicitly, and the unused `libqt5xmlpatterns5`, `libqt5multimedia5`, `libqt6charts6` and `linguist-qt6` are dropped. `PySide6` additionally loses its Qt translations and QML modules. The Qt5 and Qt6 runtimes themselves both stay, because OpenROAD's GUI is Qt5-only while KLayout, Kactus2 and Qucs-S are Qt6.
* [Build] no `pip` download cache reaches the image anymore. `PIP_NO_CACHE_DIR` is exported, because the `--no-cache-dir` flag only covers the outer `pip` and is not handed down to the nested `pip` that PEP 517 build isolation runs, which left about 55 MB of download residue; the cache directory is removed afterwards as well. The leftover `rustup` directory is now cleaned up at the end of the EDA install, since later build steps re-created it.
* [Build] audited and resolved every `FIXME` in the build scripts and the ORFS test: the obsolete `GDS_ALLOW_EMPTY` export is dropped from the `ihp-sg13g2` ORFS test, the `rftoolkit` pins are confirmed against upstream `HEAD` and `LinAlgebra` is cloned blob-filtered, the `gobject-introspection` patch documents the exact condition for dropping it and now fails loudly when upstream moves (the `LibMan` patch got the same treatment and has since been dropped, see above), the `sky130A` KLayout tech-file repairs are guarded so the build reports when `open_pdks` no longer needs them, and the OpenMPI note is marked as a permanent container constraint rather than a defect.
* [Build] extended the Python regression tests: `PySide6` is checked for a valid `__version__`, importable `chipify`/`snp2le` Qt entry points, and complete on-disk files against the installed wheel `RECORD` metadata; the CharLib test verifies the `PySpice` API actually used and that `charlib` on `PATH` is the wrapper script.
* [Docs] normalized the project name to `IIC-OSIC-TOOLS` throughout the documentation and the install scripts.
* [Docs] the "Overwriting Shell Variables" examples in `README.md` set `DOCKER_USERNAME`, which no script reads, so following them changed nothing. They set `DOCKER_USER` now.

## 2026.07

* [Adding] full [Podman](https://podman.io/) support across all start and install scripts: the container engine is auto-detected (`CONTAINER_ENGINE`), rootless mode adds `--userns=keep-id` and defaults the VNC webserver to port `8080`, and a `DOCKER_REGISTRY` variable qualifies the image name. No `podman-docker` alias or script edits are needed anymore.
* [Adding] `chipify` GUI/CLI wrapper for mismatch simulation, parameter sweeps, and yield analysis with `xschem`/`ngspice`.
* [Adding] `snp2le` to convert Touchstone S-parameter files into lumped-element netlists for `ngspice` and `vacask`.
* [Adding] VACASK setup for the IHP `SG13CMOS5L` PDK.
* [Adding] regression/smoke tests for analog circuit design, SPARX, KLayout PCells, TinyWhisper (`ihp-sg13g2`), and the `sak-drc.sh`/`sak-lvs.sh`/`sak-pex.sh` scripts.
* [Adding] `sak-pin-reorder.py` to reorder (X)SPICE `.subckt` pins to match an Xschem symbol.
* [Update] major rework of `sak-drc.sh`, `sak-lvs.sh`, and `sak-pex.sh`: KLayout DRC/LVS for all PDKs (`sky130A`, `gf180mcuD`, `ihp-sg13g2`, `ihp-sg13cmos5l`), new `gf180mcuD` DRC, gzipped and `.klay.gds` layout support, and robust workdir handling.
* [Update] `gdsfill` switched to the Rust implementation; `gf180mcu` PDK now installed via `ciel`.
* [Update] `yosys` and `slang-yosys-plugin` switched to the CMake build; `gmsh` now available on `arm64`.
* [Update] various tool and Python package version bumps (Magic, open_pdks, VACASK, iverilog, OpenROAD, and others).
* [Fix] `surfer` crash (`GLXBadFBConfig` panic) and blank window on macOS in X11 mode (XQuartz): a wrapper now forces the EGL rendering path and disables MIT-SHM presentation on TCP X connections; obsolete `surfer` alias removed.
* [Fix] broken `ngspice` mixed-signal (VHDL co-simulation) support (issue #287).
* [Fix] stale Xauth file in the VM; `libman` library loading (`capnp` libs and RPATH); moved IHP stdcell `xschem` symbols.
* [Fix] IHP `sg13g2_io` SPICE netlist name for `sg13g2tovc` (provide a `sg13g2_io.spi` compatibility symlink).
* [Fix] `xschem` parallel build race in the Makefile and headless `tcleval` focus call.
* [Fix] KLayout pcell activation for `sky130A`/`gf180mcuD` when the container `PDK` variable would otherwise fail (fall back to the generic `gdsfactory` PDK); set `GF_PDK_OPTION` for `gf180mcuC`/`gf180mcuD` to suppress the ambiguous-PDK warning.
