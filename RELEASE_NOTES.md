# IIC-OSIC-TOOLS Release Notes

This document summarizes the most important changes of the individual releases of the `IIC-OSIC-TOOLS` Docker container.

## 2026.08

* [Adding] `sak-gds-xor.py`, which XORs two layouts (GDS2/OASIS) with KLayout and writes the differing geometry out, for diffing two revisions or a signoff database against its source.
* [Adding] `sak-open`, a launcher that scans a design tree and puts up one button per design file, grouped by directory, each opening the right tool (`xschem`, KLayout, Magic, GTKWave, `gaw`, editor) in the file's own directory. The tree is rescanned periodically, the list filters by type and name, and the right mouse button offers a terminal there or the path on the clipboard.
* [Adding] `sak-render.py`, which renders a layout to PNG off-screen with the PDK's own KLayout colors and stipples, cropped to the geometry, on white and/or black. All four packaged technologies work through `-t`; `-l`/`-x` select layers by group, name or `layer/datatype` (`-l +filler` for the classic chip shot), and `--list` prints what a technology offers.
* [Adding] the `unifont` package, so unicode symbols in schematics, netlists and terminal output render instead of showing boxes.
* [Adding] a complete logo asset pack in `_logo/` (PNG and SVG, color/mono/reversed, horizontal and stacked), used for the branding refresh below.
* [Update] VACASK support for IHP `SG13CMOS5L` is complete, and the conversion now comes from upstream's own `sg13cmos5ltovc.py` ([VACASK issue #94](https://codeberg.org/arpadbuermen/VACASK/issues/94)), which also converts CMOS5L's own standard-cell and I/O netlists instead of pointing those includes at `ihp-sg13g2`. Three defects found in it were fixed upstream, so no local fixups remain; the only local addition left is the `xschem` menu listing of the `cornerDIO` and `cornerPNP` sections, which upstream omits.
* [Update] `xschem` bumped past the upstream fix for the headless `tcleval` focus call ([xschem issue #494](https://github.com/StefanSchippers/xschem/issues/494)); the local patch is removed again.
* [Update] `LibMan` bumped past the upstream Qt6 build fix ([LibMan issue #5](https://github.com/IHP-GmbH/LibMan/issues/5)); the local patch is removed again.
* [Update] the Yosys stack (`yosys`, `eqy`, `sby`, `mcy`) is held back at `v0.67`: `v0.68` removed the `abc` pass's `-fast` option, which LibreLane calls unconditionally, so every flow would die in synthesis. The pin lifts once LibreLane stops calling it.
* [Update] various tool and Python package version bumps: `bender`, `ghdl`, `iverilog`, `kepler-formal`, KLayout (`v0.30.10`), Magic (`8.3.680`), `nextpnr`, `nvc` (`r1.22.1`), `open_pdks`, `openEMS`, OpenROAD, `palace`, SiliconCompiler, `slang` and the `slang-yosys-plugin`, `spike`, `uv` (`0.12.2`), VACASK, `verible`, and `xschem`.
* [Changing] the browser (noVNC) session uses the full noVNC client instead of the `vnc_lite.html` demo page served from `/` since the container's ConSol ancestry, which adds clipboard transfer in both directions, fullscreen, ctrl-alt-del and connection settings. The advertised URL is unchanged, and the desktop now resizes to the browser window by default.
* [Changing] noVNC comes from upstream `v1.7.0` instead of Ubuntu's `1.3.0` from 2021, which carries the stuck-button defect below. Behavior is configured through the `defaults.json`/`mandatory.json` files added in `1.6.0` rather than injected query parameters, and the connection target is pinned to the address the page was loaded from, so a stale host/port cannot win over the port in use.
* [Changing] the branding is refreshed with the new logo: `README` header, noVNC favicon and tab title, JupyterLab favicons (the inverted "busy" variants included), and the desktop background, now scaled rather than centered so it is no longer cropped on narrow screens. The backdrop color `#22272E` finally applies; the value configured until now was in a format `xfdesktop` 4.18 ignores.
* [Changing] the desktop terminal is `xfce4-terminal` instead of `gnome-terminal`, whose D-Bus-activated factory frequently failed to map a window inside the container, leaving 10x10 leader windows, stray `--wait` processes and an XFCE "Input/output error" dialog. `gnome-terminal` is purged; `xterm` stays, because `xschem` spawns it for simulations.
* [Changing] double-clicking a file in Thunar (or handing it to `xdg-open`) opens the matching tool: a system-wide `mimeapps.list` and expanded MIME definitions route schematics, layouts, `.mag`, `.cdl`, netlists, waveforms and Makefiles to their viewers, with new desktop entries for GTKWave and `gaw` and an own MIME type for ngspice `.raw` (upstream that extension is a camera raw format). An audit of ~90 extensions found 21 without a handler, 15 of which are now mapped; `ristretto` and `zathura` are installed, and new test 30 checks the extension → MIME type → application chain.
* [Changing] `xschem` requires the Ctrl key to zoom and pan inside graph (waveform) widgets (`graph_use_ctrl_key`), so the wheel keeps zooming the schematic when the pointer is over a graph. Set system-wide, so it holds for all PDKs; the `Options` toggle still switches it back per session.
* [Changing] `Veryl` works out of the box: `verylup setup` runs at build time, so `veryl` and `veryl-ls` are on `PATH` with the default toolchain preinstalled and the tree stays writable for `verylup install`/`pin`. It previously failed for non-root users with `EPERM`. The `XDG_DATA_HOME` override is dropped with it.
* [Changing] the container startup was audited across all three operating modes: `DISPLAY` now defaults sensibly per host OS instead of a dead `:0`; the VNC session no longer starts `ssh-agent`, `gpg-agent`, `xiccd` or the `udisks2` volume monitor; `~/.Xauthority` is pre-created; the X11-mode terminal runs under `dbus-run-session` so `xfconfd` works; and known-harmless noVNC/GTK/dbus messages are filtered out of the container log.
* [Changing] `PyOPUS` is ported from PyQt5 to PySide6. Its threaded plotting works unchanged; the `pyog` project GUI is removed, as its table models rely on PyQt5-specific virtual dispatch.
* [Changing] the Liberty files in `libs.ref` of all packaged PDKs are now also shipped gzipped as `.lib.gz`, which the PDKs' `librelane`/`openlane`/`qflow` configurations reference and every Liberty-reading tool in the image handles. **Deprecation notice:** the uncompressed `.lib` files are kept alongside for the next few releases and will then be removed, so please migrate your own flows to the `.lib.gz` paths. The SPICE model libraries in `libs.tech/`, which share the extension, are unaffected.
* [Fix] `librelane` could not read those gzipped Liberty files in `Toolbox.get_lib_voltage()`, so `OpenROAD.IRDropReport`, the **last** step of the `Classic` flow, aborted with `Syntax error in liberty file on line 1` after everything before it had passed. Designs setting `LIB`/`CELL_LIBS` themselves were unaffected. The image patches that function to decompress first; `gzopen()` alone does not do it, as `libparse.LibertyParser` reads through the stream's `fileno()`. Reported as [librelane issue #627](https://github.com/librelane/librelane/issues/627).
* [Fix] the PDK operating-point annotation symbols (`annotate_fet_params.sym`, `annotate_bip_params.sym`) showed `NaN` in every field in `2026.07`. An upstream reentrancy guard in `translate()` was held across the Tcl evaluation, so a `tcleval(...)` callback that itself calls `xschem translate` got an empty string back; `xschem` is bumped past `f583f470` ([issue #342](https://github.com/iic-jku/IIC-OSIC-TOOLS/issues/342), [xschem issue #460](https://codeberg.org/stef_xschem/xschem/issues/460)).
* [Fix] `xschem` no longer asks whether embedded Tcl scripts may be executed, which the PDK launcher symbols and `tcleval()` attributes need. `xschem_execute_scripts yes` moved to the system-wide `xschemrc`: the user file was not enough, since `xschem` reads it only when the working directory has no `xschemrc` of its own, and every IIC design template ships one, so the setting was skipped in exactly the sessions that need it.
* [Fix] `start_vnc.sh` detects rootless Podman on macOS and Windows too. The check was gated on Linux, but the Podman machine VM is rootless as well and refuses host ports below 1024, so `WEBSERVER_PORT` stayed at `80` and container creation failed; `8080` is now auto-selected there as well. A failed start also reports the error and exits non-zero instead of still printing the VNC URL.
* [Fix] the start scripts prefixed `DOCKER_REGISTRY` to the image name even when `DOCKER_USER` already named a registry, which made a private registry unusable since `2026.07` (`docker.io/myregistry:5000/…` is an invalid reference). The prefix is now skipped when `DOCKER_USER` contains a `.` or a `:`, or is `localhost`, so `DOCKER_USER="myregistry:5000"` is all that is needed. `DOCKER_REGISTRY=none` forces unqualified names and is now available in the `.bat` scripts too, and an empty `DOCKER_USER` means the root of the registry.
* [Fix] a mouse button could get stuck down in the browser (noVNC) session, most easily the right one, after which X's implicit pointer grab sent every later click to the wrong window and focus and raising stopped working. Up to noVNC `1.5.0` the button mask is incremental state that is never re-synchronised, so a `mouseup` lost outside the window or to a native context menu leaves the bit set for good. Fixed upstream in `1.6.0`; native VNC viewers were never affected.
* [Fix] forcing VNC mode with `-V`/`--vnc`, as the entrypoint's own `--help` documents, killed the container a moment after the session came up: that flag skips the UI auto-detection, the only place that set `DISPLAY`, so `setxkbmap` failed with "Cannot open display" and `set -e` brought everything down. `DISPLAY` now defaults to `:1` whenever the VNC session starts without one.
* [Fix] the browser no longer serves a stale noVNC client after an image upgrade. `websockify` sends `Last-Modified` but no `Cache-Control`, so browsers fall back to heuristic freshness, which the `novnc` package's 2021 mtimes stretched to months. Every response now carries `Cache-Control: no-cache`. **Note:** a browser that already cached the old client cannot learn this from the server, so please reload the page once bypassing the cache (`Ctrl+Shift+R`, `Cmd+Shift+R` on macOS) after upgrading.
* [Fix] the `[INFO] noVNC HTML client started` line omitted the web server port, which misleads whenever `WEBSERVER_PORT` is not `80`, which is the default under rootless Podman. The `README` instructions had the same omission.
* [Fix] `XDG_RUNTIME_DIR` is created per user as `/tmp/runtime-<uid>` with mode `0700`, instead of the root-owned, world-writable `/tmp/runtime-default` shared by every UID, which violated the specification and made `dbus-daemon` disable its transient service directory. An externally provided `XDG_RUNTIME_DIR` (WSLg's, for example) is respected, `CONTAINER_XDG_RUNTIME_DIR` still overrides, and a forwarded Wayland socket is mounted at the neutral path `/tmp/host-wayland`.
* [Fix] `PySide6` was left broken by the removal of `PySide6-Addons`: both wheels ship the shared top-level files and `pip` does no cross-package reference counting, so uninstalling Addons deleted the `__init__.py` Essentials still needs, leaving `PySide6` a namespace package without `__version__` and breaking matplotlib's Qt backend and every GUI on top of it. Essentials is now force-reinstalled at the already resolved version.
* [Fix] `charlib` and `cir2py` are installed as wrappers that unset `PYTHONPATH` before launching their venv entry points, so the container-wide Python path no longer shadows CharLib's pinned `PySpice` fork; virtualenv binaries are no longer symlinked into `$TOOLS/bin`.
* [Fix] the `feed` parameter of the IHP `SG13CMOS5L` `cap_cmomi` capacitor can be set again in VACASK. The ngspice model writes the default symbolically and the conversion carried that over; VACASK treats such a parameter as derived and rejects every override with `Parameter 'feed' not found.`, which locked the device to `feed=double` and broke the `xschem` → VACASK path outright. Fixed in upstream's converter, and new test 29 covers `cap_cmomi` in both simulators against the capacitance the KLayout PCell prints in its own `C=` label.
* [Fix] the IHP `SG13CMOS5L` capacitor corners work in VACASK again. The PDKs install from a branch and gained `cap_cmomf` on 2026-08-11, which `cornerCAP.lib` includes in every section. VACASK's converter, however, names the models it handles in hardcoded lists, so the new device was skipped while the corner file including it was converted verbatim, and every deck pulling in that corner died on the missing include. The device lists are now completed from the installed PDK tree, so the next new device is covered too. Two install-time checks back it up: every include in the converted models must resolve, and every OSDI object the PDK's `.spiceinit` loads must exist.
* [Fix] the pcell inventory baselines of test 27 are updated for that PDK bump: `ihp-sg13g2` 37 → 38 pcells (`cap_cmomf`), `ihp-sg13cmos5l` 24 → 26 (`cap_cmomf`, `guard_ring`). No pcell is pinned as expected-empty, so the test names any new device that produces no geometry.
* [Fix] selecting the PDK at container start (`-e PDK=<pdk>`) now also selects the matching standard cell library. `STD_CELL_LIBRARY` was hardcoded to `sg13g2_stdcell`, so every other PDK silently kept pointing at the IHP `SG13G2` cells, and `GF_PDK_OPTION` was left unset for `gf180mcu`, where KLayout warns and assumes `D`. Both derive from `$PDK` now; an explicitly provided value still wins.
* [Fix] the KLayout PCell libraries of both IHP PDKs no longer break when two KLayout processes run at the same time. They preprocess each PCell module into `$TMPDIR/<module>_pre.py` under the bare module name, and both PDKs ship the same names, so on a shared `/tmp` the loser died with `FileNotFoundError`. That exception escapes the library constructor, so the PDK then registered *no* PCell at all: two KLayout windows, or a DRC job beside an interactive session, were enough. The file now carries the process ID, and test 27 gives each PDK run its own `TMPDIR`.
* [Fix] the `gf180mcuD` `efuse` PCell produces geometry instead of an empty cell. Two upstream bugs: `draw_efuse()` was called without its required `device_name` argument, and it read `efuse.gds` from a path nothing ever installs it to. Both cell libraries are patched at PDK-install time.
* [Fix] instantiating IHP PCells no longer floods the console: `sealring` shelled out to `git` in a tree carrying no `.git` and now reads the installer's `COMMIT` file, `isolbox`'s length and width defaults are corrected to the `3.6u` its own callback clamps to (geometry unchanged), and the ~35 `Box.destroy: already destroyed!` warnings per run are demoted to a verbosity-gated level.
* [Fix] `sak-pin-reorder.py` matches the `.subckt` card case-insensitively. Netlisters disagree on the spelling (`xschem` and Magic write `.subckt`, KLayout-PEX writes `.SUBCKT`), so every `kpex`-extracted netlist failed with "No .subckt line found in the netlist file". The source's spelling is carried through to the rewritten header.
* [Fix] the container works on SELinux hosts (Fedora, RHEL and clones). It runs as `container_t` while the bind-mounted GUI sockets and designs directory keep their host labels, so SELinux denied both: `start_x.sh` never showed a window and the container exited a few seconds after start, and `/foss/designs` was inaccessible in every mode. The start scripts now add `--security-opt label=disable` when the host kernel has SELinux enabled, which switches off type enforcement for that container only; relabelling the mounts instead is not an option, as the sockets belong to the host session. `IIC_OSIC_TOOLS_SELINUX_LABEL` selects another option or, exported empty, switches it off ([issue #352](https://github.com/iic-jku/IIC-OSIC-TOOLS/issues/352), README section 5.1.1). Container options are fixed at create time, so an existing container has to be re-created.
* [Fix] a container that dies during startup no longer fails silently; the SELinux failure above produced no output at all. `start_x.sh`, `start_vnc.sh` and `start_jupyter.sh` now watch the container for a few seconds, print the tail of its log with a hint when it stops, and no longer advertise a VNC or Jupyter URL for a container that already exited (`IIC_OSIC_TOOLS_NO_STARTUP_CHECK` skips the wait). Inside, an unreachable X server is reported with the display, the authority file and the likely causes.
* [Fix] `install.sh` records the container engine you picked in `$HOME/.config/iic-osic-tools/env`, which the start scripts source. It was previously used for the installation only, so on a machine that also has a `docker` CLI (a leftover, or the `podman-docker` alias) the start scripts silently auto-detected Docker again. A value set in the environment still wins.
* [Build] the build-only compiler toolchains (`clang`/LLVM, `gnat`, `gfortran`) move to `base-dev` and the unused `ant` and `binutils-gold` are dropped; the runtime image keeps GCC, `mold` and only the matching shared libraries, saving about 300 MB.
* [Build] the Python Qt bindings are consolidated on `PySide6`, saving about 115 MB: `python3-pyqt5`/`-pyqt6` leave the runtime image (PyQt5 stays in `base-dev`, where the PyOPUS build needs it), the Qt libraries they dragged in are requested explicitly, and four unused Qt packages plus `PySide6`'s translations and QML modules are dropped. Both Qt runtimes stay: OpenROAD's GUI is Qt5-only, KLayout, Kactus2 and Qucs-S are Qt6.
* [Build] no `pip` download cache reaches the image anymore. `PIP_NO_CACHE_DIR` is exported, since `--no-cache-dir` covers only the outer `pip` and not the nested one PEP 517 build isolation runs, which left about 55 MB of residue. The leftover `rustup` directory is cleaned up at the end of the EDA install, since later build steps re-created it.
* [Build] every `FIXME` in the build scripts and the ORFS test is resolved: the obsolete `GDS_ALLOW_EMPTY` export is dropped, the `rftoolkit` pins are confirmed against upstream `HEAD`, the `gobject-introspection` patch documents the exact condition for dropping it and now fails loudly when upstream moves, the `sky130A` KLayout tech-file repairs are guarded so the build reports when `open_pdks` no longer needs them, and the OpenMPI note is marked a permanent container constraint rather than a defect.
* [Build] the Python regression tests are extended: `PySide6` is checked for a valid `__version__`, importable `chipify`/`snp2le` Qt entry points and complete on-disk files against the installed wheel `RECORD`; the CharLib test verifies the `PySpice` API actually used and that `charlib` on `PATH` is the wrapper script.
* [Docs] normalized the project name to `IIC-OSIC-TOOLS` throughout the documentation and the install scripts.
* [Docs] the "Overwriting Shell Variables" examples in `README.md` set `DOCKER_USERNAME`, which no script reads, so following them changed nothing; they set `DOCKER_USER` now.

## 2026.07

* [Adding] full [Podman](https://podman.io/) support across all start and install scripts: the container engine is auto-detected (`CONTAINER_ENGINE`), rootless mode adds `--userns=keep-id` and defaults the VNC webserver to port `8080`, and a `DOCKER_REGISTRY` variable qualifies the image name. No `podman-docker` alias or script edits are needed anymore.
* [Adding] `chipify` GUI/CLI wrapper for mismatch simulation, parameter sweeps, and yield analysis with `xschem`/`ngspice`.
* [Adding] `snp2le` to convert Touchstone S-parameter files into lumped-element netlists for `ngspice` and `vacask`.
* [Adding] VACASK setup for the IHP `SG13CMOS5L` PDK.
* [Adding] regression/smoke tests for analog circuit design, SPARX, KLayout PCells, TinyWhisper (`ihp-sg13g2`), and the `sak-drc.sh`/`sak-lvs.sh`/`sak-pex.sh` scripts.
* [Adding] `sak-pin-reorder.py` to reorder (X)SPICE `.subckt` pins to match an Xschem symbol.
* [Update] major rework of `sak-drc.sh`, `sak-lvs.sh`, and `sak-pex.sh`: KLayout DRC/LVS for all PDKs (`sky130A`, `gf180mcuD`, `ihp-sg13g2`, `ihp-sg13cmos5l`), new `gf180mcuD` DRC, gzipped and `.klay.gds` layout support, and robust workdir handling.
* [Update] `gdsfill` switched to the Rust implementation; `gf180mcu` PDK now installed via `ciel`.
* [Update] `yosys` and `slang-yosys-plugin` switched to the CMake build; `gmsh` now available on `arm64`.
* [Update] various tool and Python package version bumps (Magic, open_pdks, VACASK, iverilog, OpenROAD, and others).
* [Fix] `surfer` crash (`GLXBadFBConfig` panic) and blank window on macOS in X11 mode (XQuartz): a wrapper now forces the EGL rendering path and disables MIT-SHM presentation on TCP X connections; obsolete `surfer` alias removed.
* [Fix] broken `ngspice` mixed-signal (VHDL co-simulation) support (issue #287).
* [Fix] stale Xauth file in the VM; `libman` library loading (`capnp` libs and RPATH); moved IHP stdcell `xschem` symbols.
* [Fix] IHP `sg13g2_io` SPICE netlist name for `sg13g2tovc` (provide a `sg13g2_io.spi` compatibility symlink).
* [Fix] `xschem` parallel build race in the Makefile and headless `tcleval` focus call.
* [Fix] KLayout pcell activation for `sky130A`/`gf180mcuD` when the container `PDK` variable would otherwise fail (fall back to the generic `gdsfactory` PDK); set `GF_PDK_OPTION` for `gf180mcuC`/`gf180mcuD` to suppress the ambiguous-PDK warning.
* [Remove] the dedicated `gdsfactory` virtual environments for sky130/gf180mcu: both pcell libraries are now patched at PDK-install time to run on the current system `gdsfactory` (issue #162).
* [Build] significant image size reductions: slim the runtime LLVM, strip static libraries from `xyce`/`palace`/`openroad`, remove the unused `PySide6-Addons` (QtWebEngine/Qt3D, ~410 MB), deduplicate Python packages and the PDK copy, drop bundled test suites, remove the auto-downloaded Rust toolchain, and install only Java 17.
* [Build] use GitHub mirrors for RISC-V submodule fetches; rename `tool_pip.sh` to `tool_eda.sh` and add `check_eda_tool_version.py` (also handles Cargo/Gem tools, and now prerelease versions).
* [Build] switch `buildx bake` to a DAG-based `all` target and remove the obsolete disabled `xyce-xdm` image.
* [Build] harden and speed up the regression test harness: smarter test scheduling, improved Docker test output and failure handling, and colored pass/fail output.
* [Docs] rewrite the Podman sections in `README.md`/`KNOWN_ISSUES.md` and add a macOS X11-vs-VNC performance note.

## 2026.06

* [Adding] interactive install scripts (`install.sh`, `install.bat`, `install.ps1`) that set up the prerequisites; installer logic moved to `install.ps1` and license header/disclaimer added.
* [Adding] `eda_server_bkdatadir.sh` backup script and `eda_server_rmdatadir.sh` script for managing the EDA server data directory.
* [Adding] KLayout netlist import plugin.
* [Adding] `run_palace` and `combine_snp` wrapper scripts for the `gds2palace` EM workflow.
* [Adding] `DOCKER_EXTRA_PARAMS` can now be passed in from outside the start scripts.
* [Adding] `test_ams_chip_sg13g2.sh` regression test (with option to suppress ngspice/xschem plots).
* [Update] X11 forwarding behavior; start scripts no longer abort on missing X and set the keyboard for VNC.
* [Update] various tool versions and Python package versions.
* [Fix] `gf180mcuD` access rights for KLayout macros.
* [Fix] harden startup scripts: robust container stop/remove, error checks for `docker pull`/`run`, safer permission handling, hardened `nss_wrapper` user generation, and improved X11 socket/xauth/xhost cleanup.
* [Fix] read interactive user input from `/dev/tty` (and use fd 3) instead of `stdin`.
* [Remove] `klive` from the KLayout install packages.
* [Docs] updated `KNOWN_ISSUES.md` ("Xschem Library Path"), `README.md` ("Installed PDKs"), and `TESTS.md`.

## 2026.05

* [Adding] `XKB_KEYBOARD_LAYOUT` and `XKB_KEYBOARD_VARIANT` environmental variables for `start_vnc.sh`/`start_vnc.bat` to set the keyboard layout inside the VNC session (`setxkbmap` is called in `ui_startup.sh`).
* [Update] Refactor `install_klayout.sh` to use the KLayout package manager; harmonized KLayout package list in the README.
* [Update] `sak-pex.sh` updated based on input from Tim Edwards.
* [Update] `sak-pdk` sets `KLAYOUT_PATH` only once and quotes the PDK name when sourcing `sak-pdk-script.sh`.
* [Update] VACASK commit and `sg13g2tovc` flag to fix issue #279.
* [Update] Various tool versions.
* [Fix] sky130A KLayout pcells patched to use `gf.boolean operation="-"` instead of the deprecated `"A-B"`.
* [Fix] KLayout permissions for macros (quick fix for issue #273).
* [Remove] Compact `ngspice` model generation.
* [Remove] Revert "KLayout: turn on 3x oversampling" (caused issues on some setups).
* [Build] Remove inline auto-taper patch from tool install script.

## 2026.04

* [Adding] `kepler-formal` tool for OpenROAD logic equivalence checking (LEC) support.
* [Adding] support for the IHP `SG13CMOS5L` PDK (PDK is WIP, some parts might not work correctly yet).
* [Adding] `cocotbext-ams` for mixed-signal co-simulation with `cocotb`.
* [Adding] KLayout Vector File Export plugin and CLI.
* [Adding] VACASK configuration (`.vacaskrc`) and setup for IHP SG13G2.
* [Adding] `svck` customizable SystemVerilog linter (with `verible`).
* [Adding] VNC browser access info line with auto-login URL to `start_vnc.sh` and `start_vnc.bat`.
* [Adding] `uv` Python package manager to the container image.
* [Adding] `gdsfill` Python package for dummy metal fill insertion.
* [Adding] `git-lfs` to the base container image.
* [Update] `slang-yosys-plugin` and `ghdl-yosys` plugins are moved into `/foss/tools`.
* [Update] LibreLane to 3.0.0.
* [Update] KLayout default settings: crosshair cursor, hidden empty layers, visible layer numbers, thicker DRC/LVS markers (yellow), manhattan connection mode, 3x oversampling, 10nm default grid, 4-space macro indent.
* [Update] SAK scripts (`sak-drc.sh`, `sak-pex.sh`, `sak-lvs.sh`) updated.
* [Update] gdsfactory strategy: gdsfactory 9 for `gf180mcuD`, gdsfactory 8 venv for `sky130A`.
* [Update] various tool versions.
* [Fix] KLayout netlist import for `ihp-sg13g2`: make `m=` optional and support `nf=` for MOSFET finger count.
* [Fix] AppCSXCAD GLX context failure via wrapper script (issue #254).
* [Fix] KLayout pcells for `sky130A` and `gf180mcuD` (gdsfactory version compatibility).
* [Fix] KLayout `ERROR: no PDK info found for tech` for `sky130A` and `gf180mcuD`: the pcell activation shim now falls back to the generic gdsfactory PDK on any failure (the container's ever-present `PDK` env var poisons `CONF.pdk`, so `get_active_pdk()` raises `ModuleNotFoundError`, not the `ValueError` the shim previously caught).
* [Fix] VACASK OSDI models using AVX-512 instructions (restrict to x86-64-v2).
* [Fix] non-root/rootless setup: add Podman detection and `XDG_RUNTIME_DIR` fallback in `start_x.sh`.
* [Fix] `gf180mcuD` transistor OP annotation in `xschem` symbol files.
* [Fix] prevent JSON injection in startup scripts using `jq --arg`.
* [Fix] path quoting and `PYTHONPATH`/library directory setup in profile scripts.
* [Docs] add X11 authorization failure (xauthority directory) to `KNOWN_ISSUES.md`.
* [Build] Added `build-target.sh` script to easily build individual tool targets.
* [Build] Improved version-check tools; removed `tools_lib`.
* [Build] Comprehensive hardening of install scripts: strict error handling (`set -e`), proper variable quoting, and failure checks across all tool build scripts.
* [Build] Added `SOURCES` file to every tool install, recording the tool name and commit hash for traceability.
* [Build] Added devcontainer build script and updated devcontainer image.
* [Build] Added parameter to control caching behaviour in build scripts.
* [Build] Added SPDX license headers and bumped copyright years to 2026.
